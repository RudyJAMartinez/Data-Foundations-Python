    "### Introduction\n",
    "You are a data scientist working for the government. You want to understand the public opinion regarding hurricane Maria which is responsible for killing at least 499 people in Puerto Rico. Total losses are estimated at $94.4 billion dollars which accrued to government agencies, businesses, and more importantly, familes [1]. With this background, whether you are a politician, bussiness person, or one effected by the hurricane, understanding the sentiment of the general populace is important. For this assigment, you will use a subset of the tweets retrieved from Twitter that mentioned #PuertoRico over the period of October 4 to November 7, 2017 [2] to measure the sentiment (i.e., the \"good\" or \"bad\" opinions people have about the hurricane and its impact) of this event.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, we will write code for a lexicon-based analysis (i.e., lexicon-based classification). Lexicon-based classification is a way to categorize text based using manually generated lists of topical words. Essentially, we just need to check if the topical words appear in a piece of text (e.g., a tweet). In this exercise we will make use of manually curated sentiment words. However, the basic experimental process is the same for other tasks (e.g., identifying offensive language).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested, though it is not needed, you can learn more about lexicon-based classification in Chapter 21 (21.2 and 21.6) of the free online book at the following link: [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/21.pdf)\n",

    "\n",
    "After completing the exercises below, generate a pdf of the code **with** outputs. After that create a zip file containing both the completed exercise and the generated PDF/HTML. You are **required** to check the PDF/HTML to make sure all the code **and** outputs are clearly visible and easy to read. If your code goes off the page, you should reduce the line size. I generally recommend not going over 80 characters.\n",

    "For this task, unzip and move the file \"puerto-rico.jsonl\" in to the same directory as this notebook, then complete the following exercises. However, when you turn the assigment in, do **NOT** include puerto-rico.jsonl in your zip file when you submit the homework, you will kill Blackboard.\n",

You can complete the same analysis as above, or do something different as long as you make use of a new lexicon and a new dataset. Notice some lexicons only have one class, or more than 2 classes. The processing will be slightly different. Feel free to ask how this can be done via Slack.\n",
